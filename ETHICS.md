## Purpose of Data Collection
We are collecting recipe data from different categories for educational purposes. This will enable users to quickly browse through a large amount of recipes, enhancing learning and accessibility.

## Data Sources and robots.txt Compliance
The primary data source for this project is [Preppy Kitchen](https://preppykitchen.com/category/recipes/desserts/), focusing specifically on publicly available dessert recipe categories. We adhere to the site's `robots.txt` file, which only restricts access to administrative pages.
